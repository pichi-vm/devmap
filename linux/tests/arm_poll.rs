//! Real-kernel coverage for `DM_DEV_ARM_POLL` and the `AsFd` impl that
//! makes it usable — the readiness path an async reactor would drive.
//!
//! Deliberately a test binary of its own containing a single test. The
//! kernel arms against one subsystem-wide counter, bumped by *any* dm
//! change, so a test that asserts a freshly armed fd is quiet races with
//! any concurrent device creation. Cargo runs test binaries one at a time
//! but threads the tests within a binary, so isolation here means one
//! test in one file. Anything else on the system touching dm during the
//! run could still perturb it; nothing in this suite will.
